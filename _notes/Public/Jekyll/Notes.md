# What is Jekyll?
Jekyll is a **static site generator**. It processes your site by converting Markdown files into static HTML. Jekyll uses the [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) templating language to process templates. Any files or folders that **don't** start with an underscore (`_`) are copied verbatim to the `_site` output folder when you build your site.

Example folder structure:
```
my-jekyll-site
├── _data
├── _includes
├── _layouts
├── _posts 
├── _site
├── _config.yml
├── Gemfile
├── assets
	├── css
	│    └── main.css
    ├── images
    │    └── logo.png
    └── js 
         └── scripts.js
├── index.html (could also be an .md file)
└── about.md
```

> **Gemfile (publishing with GitHub)**
> If publishing your site with GitHub Pages, you can match production version of Jekyll by using the `github-pages` gem instead of `jekyll` in your `Gemfile`. In this scenario you may also want to exclude `Gemfile.lock` from your repository because GitHub Pages ignores that file.
