| **October 4**                 | **AI Agents Hackathon - Creators Corner** <br>Our team of three developed an AI agent designed to help users find their purpose using the Ikigai concept. We built the agent using the **OpenAI API** for dynamic conversations, and integrated **Linkup.so** as our primary search engine. We also used **DataDog** for essential website monitoring - [Ikigai \| Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/ikigai-cs4aqg?ref_content=my-projects-tab&ref_feature=my_projects)                                                                                                            |
| **September 28**              | **The AI Collective - F1 Hackathon: Building the AIC Dream Team** - [F1 Hackathon: Building the AIC Dream Team · Luma](https://luma.com/n4iyk06z?tk=397xLH)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **September 2 - December 20** | Coursework @ Stevens 📚📖                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **September 1-9**             | Started learning Jekyll and ended up building this blog. The setup is simple: I write and organize my notes in Obsidian, publish them to GitHub, and the site runs on a **Jekyll** theme called [Just the Docs](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs).<br><br>**Nov 16 Update:** Switched to Jekyll Garden for a simpler interface.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **August 26-28**              | Worked on Kaggle’s infamous Titanic competition. Since I’d never completed a Kaggle competition before, it was a great way to finally get started.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Short break**               | Moved to New York to pursue my Master’s at Stevens Institute of Technology.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **May 4 - June 29**           | (Partially) vibe-coded [www.eniyirestoranlar.com](https://www.eniyirestoranlar.com/) to learn how to build an online directory. The goal was to highlight high-quality restaurants. It uses the **Google Maps Places API** for restaurant data but with a twist: I added a preprocessing step that filters out big chains (like McDonald’s, Starbucks, etc.) and lower-rated spots. This was more of an experimental project to see what vibe-coding a product with Cursor might look like. You can find the code in my GitHub [repo](https://github.com/engindenizdogu/nerede-yesem). |
| **February 17 - March 31**    | Book Study: [[Hands on ML with Scikit-Learn]] (Chapters 1-4)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
