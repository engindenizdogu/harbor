# What is NLP?
NLP is a field of linguistics and machine learning focused on understanding everything related to human language. The aim of NLP tasks is not only to understand single words individually, but to be able to understand the context of those words. [🔗](https://huggingface.co/learn/llm-course/chapter1/2)

# Why is NLP Hard?
- Semantic ambiguity: a word can have multiple meanings
- Meaning ambiguity: phrases can have multiple meanings ("Call **me** an ambulance")
- Prepositional phrase attachment ambiguity: "**San Jose cops** kill **man** with **knife**"
- Pronoun reference ambiguity: Dr. Macklin often brings his dog to visit the patients. **He** just loves to give kisses.
- Lingo: LOL (laugh out loud), Idk (I don't know), brb (be right back) etc.
- Meanings shift across time: same word can have different interpretation over the years
- Scale: the Web contains billions of words

# A spectrum of NLP problems
- **Part-of-Speech Tagging:** (tag prepositions, pronouns, adjectives, nouns etc.)
- **Syntactic (Constituency) Tagging:** (NP: Noun Phrase (the hungry cat), VP: Verb Phrase (chased the mouse), PP: Prepositional Phrase (in the house), S: Sentence)
- **Syntactic Categories** (Lexical and phrasal categories together are called syntactic categories)
- **Dependency Parsing:** Dependencies are asymmetrical relations between two lexical items (words)

> Unlike constituency parsing, dependency parsing does **not** utilize the phrasal constituents or sub-phrases.

- **Semantic Analysis**
- **Co-reference Resolution**
- **Discourse Analysis**
- **Learning Representations**

# HuggingFace Pipelines/Tasks
**Text pipelines**
- `text-generation`: Generate text from a prompt
- `text-classification`: Classify text into predefined categories
- `summarization`: Create a shorter version of a text while preserving key information
- `translation`: Translate text from one language to another
- `zero-shot-classification`: Classify text without prior training on specific labels
- `feature-extraction`: Extract vector representations of text

**Image pipelines**
- `image-to-text`: Generate text descriptions of images
- `image-classification`: Identify objects in an image
- `object-detection`: Locate and identify objects in images

**Audio pipelines**
- `automatic-speech-recognition`: Convert speech to text
- `audio-classification`: Classify audio into categories
- `text-to-speech`: Convert text to spoken audio

**Multimodal pipelines**
- `image-text-to-text`: Respond to an image based on a text prompt
