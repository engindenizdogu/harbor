title: Large Language Models
---
**Characteristics of LLMs:**
- **Scale**: They contain millions, billions, or even hundreds of billions of parameters
- **General capabilities**: They can perform multiple tasks without task-specific training
- **In-context learning**: They can learn from examples provided in the prompt
- **Emergent abilities**: They can demonstrate capabilities that weren’t explicitly programmed or anticipated

**Limitations of LLMs:**
- **Hallucinations**: They can generate incorrect information confidently
- **Lack of true understanding**: They lack true understanding of the world and operate purely on statistical patterns
- **Bias**: They may reproduce biases present in their training data or inputs.
- **Context windows**: They have limited context windows (though this is improving)
- **Computational resources**: They require significant computational resources
