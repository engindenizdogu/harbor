# Derivatives
Let $f(x)$ be a function defined in an open interval containing $a$. The derivative of a function $f(x)$ at $a$ is denoted by $f'(x)$ and is defined by:

$$f'(a) = \lim_{h\to0} {f(a+h) - f(a)\over h}$$

**Differentiation Rules:**
- Constant rule
- Power rule
- Sum rule
- Difference rule
- Constant multiple rule
- Product rule
- Quotient rule

**Chain Rule**
If we have $h(x)=f(g(x))$ then $h'(x)=f'(g(x))g'(x)$

**Derivatives of Exponentials & Logarithms**

$${d \over dx}(b^{g(x)}) = b^{g(x)}g'(x)ln(b)$$


$${d \over dx}(log_b{g(x)}) = {g'(x) \over g(x)ln(b)}$$

# Numerical Differentiation
* One-sided (forward) difference:
 
$${f(a+h) - f(a)\over h}$$

* One-sided (backward) difference:

$${f(a) - f(a-h)\over h}$$

* The central difference:

$${f(a+h) - f(a - h)\over 2h}$$

# Fermat's Theorem
If $f$ has a local extremum at $c$ and $f$ is differentiable at $c$, then $f'(c)=0$.

> **Extreme Value Theorem:** A continuous function over a closed, bounded interval has an absolute maximum and minimum. Each extremum occurs at a critical point or an endpoint.

# Rolle's Theorem
Let $f$ be a continuous function over the closed interval $[a,b]$ and differentiable over the open interval $(a,b)$ such that $f(a) = f(b)$. There then exists at least one $c$ $\epsilon(a,b)$ such that $f'(c) = 0$.

# Mean Value Theorem
Let $f$ be continuous over the closed interval $[a,b]$ and differentiable over the open interval $(a,b)$. Then, there exists at least one point $c$ $\epsilon(a,b)$, such that:

$$f'(c)={f(b)-f(a)\over b-a}$$

1. If $f'(x)>0$ for all $x$$\epsilon (a,b)$, then $f$ is an increasing function over $[a,b]$
2. If $f'(x)<0$ for all $x$$\epsilon (a,b)$, then $f$ is an decreasing function over $[a,b]$

# Convex vs Concave Functions

| **Feature**           | **Convex**                   | **Concave**                  |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Visual Shape**      | Cup / Smile ($\cup$)         | Cap / Frown ($\cap$)         |
| **Midpoint Test**     | Line is above the curve      | Line is below the curve      |
| **Optimization**      | Easy to find the **minimum** | Easy to find the **maximum** |
| **Second Derivative** | $f''(x) \ge 0$               | $f''(x) \le 0$               |
