1. **Classification Problems (Supervised Learning)**
	1. **Discriminant Functions**: When you just need accurate classifications and don't care about probabilities (e.g., image classification for labeling). Example algorithms: Perceptron, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees
	2. **Discriminative Models**: When you need probability estimates for uncertainty or decision-making (e.g., medical diagnosis, ranking). Example algorithms: Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, Conditional Random Fields (CRF)
	3. **Generative Models**: When you need to generate samples, handle missing data, or have strong prior knowledge about data distribution (e.g., anomaly detection, small datasets). Example algorithms: Naïve Bayes, Gaussian Discriminant Analysis (GDA), Hidden Markov Models (HMM), Variational Autoencoders (VAE)
2. **Regression Problems (Supervised Learning)** - Predicting continuous values (house prices, temperature, stock prices). Example algorithms: Linear regression, regression trees, neural networks for regression
3. **Unsupervised Learning** - No labels provided
	 - **Clustering**: k-means, hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN
	 - **Dimensionality reduction**: PCA, t-SNE, auto-encoders, manifold learning
	 - **Density estimation**: Finding p(x) without caring about classes
4. **Other Common Tasks**:
	- Reinforcement Learning: learning through trial and error with rewards
	- Q-learning, policy gradients, AlphaGo
	- Anomaly detection
	- Recommendation systems
	- Time series forecasting
	- Ranking problems
	- Semi-supervised learning
	- Transfer learning
	- Ensemble methods combine multiple approaches
