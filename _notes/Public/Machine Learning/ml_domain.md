1. **Discriminant Functions**: When you just need accurate classifications and don't care about probabilities (e.g., image classification for labeling)
	- Perceptron, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees
2. **Discriminative Models**: When you need probability estimates for uncertainty or decision-making (e.g., medical diagnosis, ranking)
	- Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, Conditional Random Fields (CRF)
3. **Generative Models**: When you need to generate samples, handle missing data, or have strong prior knowledge about data distribution (e.g., anomaly detection, small datasets)
	- Naïve Bayes, Gaussian Discriminant Analysis (GDA), Hidden Markov Models (HMM), Variational Autoencoders (VAE)
4. **Regression Problems** - Predicting continuous values (house prices, temperature, stock prices)
	-  Examples: Linear regression, regression trees, neural networks for regression
5. **Unsupervised Learning** - No labels provided
	 - **Clustering**: k-means, hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN
	 - **Dimensionality reduction**: PCA, t-SNE, autoencoders
	 - **Density estimation**: Finding p(x) without caring about classes
6. **Reinforcement Learning** - Learning through trial and error with rewards
	- Q-learning, policy gradients, AlphaGo
7. **Other Tasks**:
	- Anomaly detection
	- Recommendation systems
	- Time series forecasting
	- Ranking problems
	- Semi-supervised learning
	- Transfer learning
	- Ensemble methods combine multiple approaches
