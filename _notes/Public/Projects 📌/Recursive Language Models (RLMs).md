**Key Features:**
- Engineered a multi-layered RLM system with context window optimization to process 10M+ token inputs, enabling analysis of full-length documents without truncation
- Benchmarked multiple LLM configurations through systematic model evaluation, optimizing prompt engineering strategies to reduce cost
