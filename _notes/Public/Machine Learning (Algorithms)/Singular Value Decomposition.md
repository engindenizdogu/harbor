Please see "Singular Value Decomposition" section under [[2. Linear Algebra]] for SVD formulation.

**Possible Limitations of SVD:**
- Computational cost scales quadratically
- Different learning regime than other DL models
- Bad for millions of words or documents (if used for [[3. Word Vectors]] in NLP - See section "Representing with a Co-occurrence Matrix")
- Hard to incorporate new words or documents (if used for [[3. Word Vectors]] in NLP - See section "Representing with a Co-occurrence Matrix")
