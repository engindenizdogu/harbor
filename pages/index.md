## Hi, I'm Deniz...
I'm a master's student in *Machine Learning @ Stevens Institute of Technology*. I created this site to keep my notes organized and build my own knowledge base. The topics you see here are drawn from my work and studies. While not all entries are fully detailed, they serve as a reminder that I’ve engaged with or need to explore the topic further. For my yearly log see, [[Year in Review ✨]].

*Feel free to look around. I hope you’ll find something helpful here!*

> **Fun Fact:** This site was based on [Jekyll Garden](https://jekyll-garden.github.io/). I use Obsidian to write and organize my markdown notes, which are then publish directly to GitHub. If you’re curious, you can check out my notes about Jekyll.
