## Hi, I'm Deniz...
I'm a master's student in *Machine Learning @ Stevens Institute of Technology*. I created this site to keep my notes organized and build my own knowledge base (and since it could also double as a portfolio, I thought, why not turn it into a documentation blog). I’ll also be using it as a personal blog. Feel free to look around. I hope you’ll find something helpful here!

> **Fun Fact:** This site was based on [Jekyll Garden -Your Name](https://jekyll-garden.github.io/). I use Obsidian to write and organize my markdown notes, which are then publish directly to GitHub. If you’re curious, you can check out my notes about Jekyll.
