# Harbor - Knowledge Base

A personal knowledge base for Machine Learning topics, course notes, and technical documentation. Built with Jekyll and based on [Jekyll Garden](https://github.com/Jekyll-Garden/jekyll-garden.github.io).

## About

This site serves as an organized collection of notes from my studies in Machine Learning at Stevens Institute of Technology. Topics include:

- Machine Learning algorithms and concepts
- Math for ML (Linear Algebra, Probability, Statistics)

The notes are written in Obsidian and published directly to GitHub Pages, with wiki-style `[[links]]` connecting related concepts.
